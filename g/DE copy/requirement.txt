- the script should scrape data link in image scrape.png and save the data in mysql table
		example links: 	https://www.amazon.de/sp?ie=UTF8&seller=A1K6TAQBRYGCP&asin=B097TTLDSP&ref_=dp_merchant_link&isAmazonFulfilled=1
				https://www.amazon.de/sp?ie=UTF8&seller=A2YFS0NG9CL2RQ&asin=B06WVD8C6H&ref_=dp_merchant_link&isAmazonFulfilled=1

- exclude chinese sellers from saving
- the script should run with a random sleep between 55 and 165 seconds becourse amazon is blocking ip’s

- also scrape new product links from product page and store the links in mysql table for later use
		example link:	https://www.amazon.de/dp/B097TTLDSP/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?pf_rd_p=ae2317a0-2175-4285-af64-66539858231f&pf_rd_r=3DTVE93WZ4VWH9TNR3P4&pd_rd_wg=z3NVG&pd_rd_w=FdyMs&content-id=amzn1.sym.ae2317a0-2175-4285-af64-66539858231f&pd_rd_r=2e780df6-7700-47d0-b4b4-1822c02be39b&s=drugstore&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWw&th=1

The bst way will be that you create a mysql table with product detail pages links, to start the script.

make it with 3 colums, id, link and a boolean that is be set to “1” if the link is already be searched by the script

on the product detail pages you will get more product links to save in this table and also the seller detaild page link

see: image1.png

on the seller page you scrape the green marked information like shown in scrape.png expect chinese seller
